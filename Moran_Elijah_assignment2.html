<p>In the military, everyone is strict about timeliness, appearance, respect, job skills, and flexibility.</p>
<p>In this theme, I was scheduled for work at 1600 (4:00 pm civilian time). I had a few decisions to make prior to leaving for work. </p>
<p>For all who have not been affiliated with the military, coffee is a necessity due to the long hours required to work. If you don't eat your body may not have the sustainability required for the mission.  </p>
